# 1. `import random`: This line imports the `random` module, which provides various functions for generating random numbers and selecting random elements.

# 2. `names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")`: This line prompts the user to enter a string containing names separated by commas. The `input()` function is used to obtain user input, and the entered string is stored in the `names_string` variable.

# 3. `names = names_string.split(", ")`: This line splits the `names_string` using the `split()` method. The string is split at each occurrence of a comma followed by a space, resulting in a list of names. The resulting list is stored in the `names` variable.

# 4. `num_items = len(names)`: This line calculates the length of the `names` list using the `len()` function. The length indicates the total number of items (names) in the list, and the result is stored in the `num_items` variable.

# 5. `random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1)`: This line generates a random integer between 0 and `num_items - 1` (inclusive) using the `random.randint()` function from the `random` module. The `randint()` function takes two arguments: the start and end of the range (inclusive). The randomly generated integer is assigned to the `random_choice` variable.

# 6. `person_paying = names[random_choice]`: This line selects the name from the `names` list at the index specified by `random_choice`. It retrieves the name corresponding to the randomly chosen index and assigns it to the `person_paying` variable.

# 7. `print(person_paying + ' is going to buy the meal today!')`: This line prints the randomly selected `person_paying` along with the message "is going to buy the meal today!" to the console.

# In summary, your code prompts the user to enter names separated by commas, splits the string into a list of names, selects a random name from the list, and then prints the selected name along with a message indicating that the person is going to buy the meal.
